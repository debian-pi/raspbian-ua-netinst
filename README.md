## Intro

The minimal Raspbian unattended netinstaller for Raspberry Pi Model 1B, 1B+, 2B and 3B.

This project provides [Raspbian][1] power users the possibility to install a minimal base system unattended using latest Raspbian packages regardless when the installer was built.

The installer with default settings configures eth0 with DHCP to get Internet connectivity and completely wipes the SD card from any previous installation.

There are different kinds of "presets" that define the default packages that are going to be installed. Currently, the default one is called _server_ which installs only the essential base system packages including _NTP_ and _OpenSSH_ to provide a sane minimal base system that you can immediately after install ssh in and continue installing your software.

Other presets include _minimal_ which has even less packages (no logging, no text editor, no cron) and _base_ which doesn't even have networking. You can customize the installed packages by adding a small configuration file to your SD card before booting up.

## Features
 - completely unattended, you only need working Internet connection through the Ethernet port
 - DHCP and static ip configuration (DHCP is the default)
 - always installs the latest version of Raspbian
 - configurable default settings
 - extra configuration over HTTP possible - gives unlimited flexibility
 - installation takes about **15 minutes** with fast Internet from power on to sshd running
 - can fit on 512MB SD card, but 1GB is more reasonable
 - default install includes fake-hwclock to save time on shutdown
 - default install includes NTP to keep time
 - /tmp is mounted as tmpfs to improve speed
 - no clutter included, you only get the bare essential packages
 - option to install root to USB drive

## Requirements
 - a Raspberry Pi Model 1B, Model 1B+ or Model 2B
 - SD card of at least 640MB or at least 128MB for USB root install (without customization)
 - working Ethernet with Internet connectivity

## Writing the installer to the SD card
### Obtaining installer files on Windows and Mac
Installer archive is around **19MB** and contains all firmware files and the installer.

Go to [our latest release page](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst/releases/latest) and download the .zip file.

Format your SD card as **FAT32** (MS-DOS on _Mac OS X_) and extract the installer files in.  
**Note:** If you get an error saying it can't mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 on /boot then the most likely cause is that you're using exFAT instead of FAT32.
Try formatting the SD card with this tool: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/

### Alternative method for Mac, writing image to SD card
Prebuilt image is around **19MB** bzip2 compressed and **64MB** uncompressed. It contains the same files as the .zip but is more convenient for Mac users.

Go to [our latest release page](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst/releases/latest) and download the .img.bz2 file.

Extract the .img file from the archive with `bunzip2 raspbian-ua-netinst-<latest-version-number>.img.bz2`.  
Find the _/dev/diskX_ device you want to write to using `diskutil list`. It will probably be 1 or 2.  

To flash your SD card on Mac:

    diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX
    sudo dd bs=1m if=/path/to/raspbian-ua-netinst-<latest-version-number>.img of=/dev/rdiskX
    diskutil eject /dev/diskX

_Note the **r** in the of=/dev/rdiskX part on the dd line which should speed up writing the image considerably._

### SD card image for Linux
Prebuilt image is around **17MB** xz compressed and **64MB** uncompressed. It contains the same files as the .zip but is more convenient for Linux users.

Go to [our latest release page](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst/releases/latest) and download the .img.xz file.

To flash your SD card on Linux:

    xzcat /path/to/raspbian-ua-netinst-<latest-version-number>.img.xz > /dev/sdX

Replace _/dev/sdX_ with the real path to your SD card.

## Installing
In normal circumstances, you can just power on your Pi and cross your fingers.

If you don't have a display attached you can monitor the Ethernet card leds to guess activity. When it finally reboots after installing everything you will see them going out and on a few times when Raspbian configures it on boot.

If you do have a display, you can follow the progress and catch any possible errors in the default configuration or your own modifications.  
If you have a serial cable, then remove 'console=tty1' at then end of the `cmdline.txt` file.

**Note:** During the installation you'll see various warning messages, like "Warning: cannot read table of mounted file systems" and "dpkg: warning: ignoring pre-dependency problem!". Those are expected and harmless.

## Installer customization
You can use the installer _as is_ and get a minimal system installed which you can then use and customize to your needs.  
But you can also customize the installation process and the primary way to do that is through a file named _installer-config.txt_. When you've written the installer to a SD card, you'll see a file named _cmdline.txt_ and you create the _installer-config.txt_ file alongside that file.
The defaults for _installer-config.txt_ are displayed below. If you want one of those settings changed for your installation, you should **only** place that changed setting in the _installer-config.txt_ file. So if you want to have vim and aptitude installed by default, create a _installer-config.txt_ file with the following contents:
```
packages=vim,aptitude
```
and that's it! While most settings stand on their own, some settings influence each other. For example `rootfstype` is tightly linked to the other settings that start with `rootfs_`.  
So don't copy and paste the defaults from below!

The _installer-config.txt_ is read in at the beginning of the installation process, shortly followed by the file pointed to with `online_config`, if specified.
There is also another configuration file you can provide, _post-install.txt_, and you place that in the same directory as _installer-config.txt_.
The _post-install.txt_ is executed at the very end of the installation process and you can use it to tweak and finalize your automatic installation.  
The configuration files are read in as  shell scripts, so you can abuse that fact if you so want to.

The format of the _installer-config.txt_ file and the current defaults:

    gpu_mem=                  # specify the amount of RAM in MB that should be reserved for the GPU

The timeserver parameter is only used during installation for _rdate_ which is used as fallback when setting the time with `ntpdate` fails.  

Available presets: _server_, _minimal_ and _base_.
Presets set the `cdebootstrap_cmdline` variable. For example, the current _server_ default is:

> _--flavour=minimal --include=kmod,fake-hwclock,ifupdown,net-tools,isc-dhcp-client,ntp,openssh-server,vim-tiny,iputils-ping,wget,ca-certificates,rsyslog,dialog,locales,less,man-db_

(If you build your own installer, which most won't need to, and the configuration files exist in the same directory as this `README.md`, it will be include in the installer image automatically.)

### Bring your own files
You can have the installer place your custom configuration files (or any other file you wish to add) on the installed system during the installation. For this, you need to provide the necessary files in the `/config/files/` directory of your SD card (you may need to create this directory if it doesn't exist). The `/config/files/` directory is the root-point. It must have the same structure as inside the installed system. So, a file that you place on the SD card in `/config/files/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` will end up on the installed system as `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`.
Each file or directory that you wish to place on the target system must also be listed in a configuration file in the directory `/config` on your SD card. This allows you to specify the owner (and group) and the permissions of the file. An example file is provided with the installer (see `/config/my-files.list` for more information). ONLY files listed there are copied over to the installed system.
To have the installer actually copy the files to the target system, add the following command at an appropriate point in your `post-install.txt` file:
```
install_files my-files.list
```
where `my-files.list` is the name of the file containing the list of files.
If needed, you can call `install_files` multiple times with different list files.  
Please be aware that some restrictions may apply to the sum of the file sizes. If you wish to supply large files in this manner you may need to adjust the value of the `bootsize` parameter.

### Custom installer script

It is possible to replace the installer script completely, without rebuilding the installer image. To do this, place a custom `rcS` file in the config directory of your SD card. The installer script will check this location and run this script instead of itself. Take great care when doing this, as it is intended to be used for development purposes.

Should you still choose to go this route, please use the original [rcs](https://github.com/debian-pi/raspbian-ua-netinst/blob/master/scripts/etc/init.d/rcS) file as a starting point.

## IP Networking

The installer supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networking, although the default configuration is to use only IPv4. Networking can be configured using the 'ip4' and 'ip6'
options in the installer-config.txt file (details below), and the configuration will be replicated into the installed system.

If the installer cannot configure at least one IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) it will abort, as networking is required to perform the installation.

### IPv4

The default for IPv4 is to use DHCP to obtain an address/prefix, default gateway, and DNS resolver(s). The installer can be configured in three IPv4 modes:

- DHCP

  Set 'ip4_addr' to 'dhcp'. The remaining 'ip4' configuration options will be ignored if set.

- Static

  Set 'ip4_addr' to an IPv4 address, and 'ip4_prefixlength' to the appropriate value for your network (the most common prefix length is 24, which corresponds to
  a netmask of 255.255.255.0). Set 'ip4_gateway' to the address of the default gateway, and 'ip4_nameservers' to the address of the DNS resolver which should be used (if
  there are multiple DNS resolvers, their addresses can be included in this option, separated by spaces).

- Disabled

  Set 'ip4_addr' to 'disable'. The remaining 'ip4' configuration options will be ignored if set.

### IPv6

The default for IPv6 is to disable its use; even if the network advertises IPv6 information, it will not be used. Note that DHCPv6 is *not*
supported, as there is no suitable DHCPv6 client available for use in the installer environment. If the network indicates that DHCPv6 is required
for addressing or any other network information, the installer will not use IPv6. The installed system can use DHCPv6, but the installer
is unable to configure it in that mode.

For those unfamiliar with IPv6 networking, there are some significant differences from IPv4, in addition to the size of addresses. Most importantly,
IPv6 networks can provide automatic addressing, automatic gateway discovery, and automatic DNS resolver discovery, but these can be provided
independently. As a result, configuration of the installer for IPv6 is done in three parts.

The simplest configuration is when the network supports SLAAC and RDNSS; this is roughly equivalent to IPv4 DHCP, and the installer will be
able to automatically assign an address, gateway, and get DNS resolver address(es).

#### Addressing

The installer can be configured in three modes:

- Automatic

  Set 'ip6_addr' to 'auto'. 'ip6_prefixlength' will be ignored if set. In this mode, the kernel will use incoming Router Advertisements
  to determine network prefix information, and will use SLAAC (RFC 4862 - IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) to generate an address.
  If no RAs are received, or they do not contain on-link prefixes, the kernel will be unable to generate an address, and IPv6 support will be
  disabled.

- Static

  Set 'ip6_addr' to an IPv6 address, and 'ip6_prefixlength' to the appropriate value for your network (the most common prefix length is 64). In
  this mode any network prefixes received in RAs will be ignored.

- Disabled

  Set 'ip6_addr' to 'disable'. The remaining 'ip6' configuration options will be ignored if set.

#### Gateways

IPv6 networks nearly always distribute gateway (router) addresses via Router Advertisements, as IPv6 routers typically use link-local addresses
which can be dynamically changed. However, the installer does support static configuration. There are two configuration modes:

- Automatic

  Set 'ip6_gateway' to 'auto'. In this mode the kernel will determine gateway(s) to use based on Router Advertisements it receives.

- Static

  Set 'ip6_gateway' to an IPv6 address. In this mode any gateway addresses received in RAs will be ignored.

#### DNS Resolvers

Some IPv6 networks distribute DNS resolver information in Router Advertisements, using RDNSS (RFC 6106 - IPv6 Router Advertisment Options for
DNS Configuration); others require static configuration, or do not provide DNS resolution via IPv6. The installer can be configured in three
modes:

- Automatic

  Set 'ip6_nameservers' to 'auto'. In this mode the system will determine DNS resolver(s) to use based on Router Advertisements it receives.
  Note that this mode requires the 'rdnssd' package, which provides a daemon to process the RDNSS options in the RAs, so this package will be
  added to the installed system.

- Static

  Set 'ip6_nameservers' to the address of the DNS resolver which should be used (if there are multiple DNS resolvers, their addresses
  can be included in this option, separated by spaces).

- Disabled

  Set 'ip6_nameservers' to 'disable'. This is only necessary to stop the installer from installing the 'rdnssd' package on networks which
  do not provide DNS resolution over IPv6.

## Logging
The output of the installation process is now also logged to file.  
When the installation completes successfully, the logfile is moved to /var/log/raspbian-ua-netinst.log on the installed system.  
When an error occurs during install, the logfile is moved to the sd card, which gets normally mounted on /boot/ and will be named raspbian-ua-netinst-\<datetimestamp\>.log

## First boot
The system is almost completely unconfigured on first boot. Here are some tasks you most definitely want to do on first boot.

The default **root** password is **raspbian**.

> Set new root password: `passwd`  (can also be set during installation using **rootpw** in [installer-config.txt](#installer-customization))  
> Configure your default locale: `dpkg-reconfigure locales`  
> Configure your timezone: `dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`  

The latest kernel and firmware packages are now automatically installed during the unattended installation process.
When you need a kernel module that isn't loaded by default, you will still have to configure that manually.

> Optional: `apt-get install raspi-copies-and-fills` for improved memory management performance.  
> Optional: Create a swap file with `dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1M count=512 && mkswap /swap && chmod 600 /swap` (example is 512MB) and enable it on boot by appending `/swap none swap sw 0 0` to `/etc/fstab`.  

## Reinstalling or replacing an existing system
If you want to reinstall with the same settings you did your first install you can just move the original _config.txt_ back and reboot. Depending on the hardware you want to reinstall on (Raspberry Pi **1** or **2**), make sure you still have _kernel_rpi1_install.img_ / _kernel_rpi2_install.img_ and _installer-rpi1.cpio.gz_ / _installer-rpi2.cpio.gz_ in your _/boot_ partition. If you are replacing your existing system which was not installed using this method, make sure you copy those files in and the installer _config.txt_ from the original image.

    mv /boot/config-reinstall.txt /boot/config.txt
    reboot

**Remember to backup all your data and original config.txt before doing this!**

## Reporting bugs and improving the installer
When you encounter issues, have wishes or have code or documentation improvements, we'd like to hear from you!
We've actually written a document on how to best do this and you can find it [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Disclaimer
We take no responsibility for ANY data loss. You will be reflashing your SD card anyway so it should be very clear to you what you are doing and will lose all your data on the card. Same goes for reinstallation.
